# VC-5 Test Materials License

**Reference Decoder, Sample Encoder, and Utilities**

**Business and Legal Terms**

The sample code including the VC-5 reference decoder, sample encoder, and certain utility programs and scripts provided to assist in testing the reference decoder and sample encoder are provided as source code.  Sample images and VC-5 bitstreams are provided to assist in testing the VC-5 reference decoder and sample encoder.

The source code, test images, and bitstreams are collectively called the test materials. The test materials are distributed by SMPTE and GoPro under the following terms and conditions:
1.	The test materials will be jointly copyrighted by SMPTE and GoPro.
2.	GoPro retains rights to the test materials.
3.	SMPTE may sell the test materials at a price determined by SMPTE.
4.	GoPro may sell the sample encoder or reference decoder or works derived from the sample encoder or decoder at a price that is determined by GoPro, under terms that may include recurring charges paid directly to GoPro.
5.	It is expected that GoPro will typically charge a higher price than SMPTE for the sample encoder and reference decoder in return for support and maintenance.
6.	GoPro may provide the utility programs and test scripts in source or binary form, excluding the sample encoder and reference decoder, to its customers and at its discretion may waive all charges for providing the utility programs and test scripts to its customers.
7.	GoPro may use the test materials to develop commercial products.
8.	A purchaser of the test materials, whether from SMPTE or GoPro, may use the test materials to develop commercial products (derivative works), but may not redistribute the test materials in their original form.
9.	Test materials may be subject to license fees paid to a patent pool under reasonable and non-discriminatory license terms.
10.	Neither SMPTE nor GoPro are liable for any use of the test materials.
11.	Updates to the test materials made by GoPro will be provided to SMPTE promptly.
