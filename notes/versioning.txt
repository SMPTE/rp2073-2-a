# Version Numbering

Notes on the scheme for automatically updating the version numbers in all source code and documentation.


## Version Numbers

Need to update the version numbers in the following locations:

* Source code version in $(ROOT)/common/include/version.h
* Update the project number in encoder.doxy
* Update the project number in decoder.doxy
* Update the version number in the build instructions
* Update the version number in the release notes

Need version number for the metadata tools?

Need version number for the Python scripts?


## Codec Source Code

The version number is stored in the encoder data structure but otherwise does not seem to be used.


Add command-line switch to the sample encoder, reference decoder, and other programs to print the version number:

	encoder --version

long-form only, no short switch, and add the version information to the output of the help option.


## Tools

### VC-5 Bitstream Info

Write a tool `vc5info` for extracting information about the bitstream such as the information in the
version chunk, image encoding format, image dimensions and pixel format.


## Automatic Updates
